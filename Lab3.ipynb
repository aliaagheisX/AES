It supports various deep learning operations and models, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. For Windows users, the installation also requires ensuring that CUDA, provided by NVIDIA, is compatible to enable GPU acceleration. This enhances performance significantly, particularly in training large neural networks.\\\n",

        "\n",
        "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that iteratively learn from data and improve their accuracy over time by optimizing an error metric, typically through the use of loss functions. These functions quantify the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs, guiding the algorithm to minimize this error during training. By continually adjusting and improving, machine learning models can achieve remarkable accuracy in tasks ranging from simple classification to complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized kind of neural networks particularly effective for analyzing visual imagery. They employ a mathematical operation known as convolution, which uses sliding window techniques to process data. This method is highly efficient in recognizing patterns and features in images due to the sparse interactions and parameter sharing of convolutional layers. These characteristics allow CNNs to capture local patterns like edges and textures with a significantly reduced amount of parameters compared to fully connected networks, making them highly efficient for tasks involving high-dimensional data like images.\n",
